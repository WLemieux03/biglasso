\title{deviance and log-likelihood calculations for fitted Cox models}
\usage{
cox.deviance(X, y, offset = NULL, beta, row.idx = 1:nrow(X))
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{The design matrix, without an intercept. It must be a
double type \code{\link[bigmemory]{big.matrix}} object.}

\item{y}{A response vector.}

\item{offset}{Optional offset vector.}

\item{beta}{Fitted coefficients obtained from a \code{\link[biglasso]{biglasso}} object. Expected to be 
a matrix (or something coercible to a \code{"dgTMatrix"} object) with ncols corresponding to the number
of lambdas used in the penalization path and nrows corresponding to the number of model covariates.}

\item{row.idx}{Integer vector of row/observation indices to be used in computing model likelihoods.
Default set to \code{1:nrow(X)}.}
}
\value{
A list with deviance and log-likelihood values calculated over the fitted coefficients.
\item{nulldev}{The null deviance of the model defined to be -2 * (loglike_sat - loglike_null), where the null
model in the context of Cox regression refers to the 0 model.} \item{dev}{Fitted deviance associated with
the observations and fitted coefficients. Defined to be -2 * (loglike_sat - loglike), where loglike
is calculated using the Breslow approximation of the Cox model likelihood.} \item{dev.ratio}{The fraction of
(null) deviance explained, dev.ratio = 1 - dev/nulldev. Calculated primarily as a way to quickly compare
outputs with those of \code{"glmnet"}.}
}
\description{
Calculate the deviances (model, null) and log-likelihoods (saturated, model, null) 
associated with a set of observations and fitted coefficients.
